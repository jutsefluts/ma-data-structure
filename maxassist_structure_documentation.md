Max Assist Data Structure Documentation

This document explains the structure of the lesson data used in our lesson generator system.

Overall Structure

The lesson data is structured as a JSON array containing a single object with the following top-level fields:

onderwerp: The subject or topic of the lesson
doelgroep: The target audience for the lesson
leeropbrengst: The learning outcome of the lesson
ai_feedback: Feedback provided by AI on the lesson structure
lesstructuur: The main structure of the lesson, divided into phases
Lesson Structure (lesstructuur)

The lesstructuur contains four phases of a lesson:

instructie: The instruction phase
verwerking: The processing or practice phase
afronding: The conclusion phase
introductie: The introduction phase
Each phase is an array that can contain multiple elements.

Element Structure

Each element in a phase has the following structure:

uuid: A unique identifier for the element
#type: The type of the element (e.g., "processed_text", "document_file", "radios", "textarea")
Other fields specific to the element type, all prefixed with "#"
UUID Field
The "uuid": "" field should be populated with a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for each element. This UUID is typically generated by the system and ensures that each element can be uniquely identified within the lesson and across the entire application.

Example of a UUID: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"

Usage

This structure allows for flexible lesson creation, where any type of element can be added to any phase of the lesson. The system generating or processing this data should ensure that:

Each element has a unique UUID.
The appropriate fields are filled for each element type.
The overall structure (onderwerp, doelgroep, leeropbrengst, ai_feedback) is completed for each lesson.
