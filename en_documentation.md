Max Assist Data Structure Documentation

This document explains the structure of the lesson data used in our lesson generator system.

## Overall Structure

The lesson data is structured as a JSON array (denoted by square brackets []) containing a single object with the following top-level fields:

- `lesson_prerequisites`: An array of prerequisite questions for the lesson
- `lesson_structure`: The main structure of the lesson, divided into phases

## Lesson Prerequisites

The `lesson_prerequisites` is an array of question objects. Each question object has the following structure:

```json
{
  "question_key": "",
  "question_text": "",
  "answer": ""
}
```

The number of questions is flexible and can be adjusted as needed. These questions typically cover topics such as:
- Target audience
- Lesson subject
- Intended learning outcomes

## Lesson Structure

The `lesson_structure` contains four phases of a lesson:

- `instruction`: The instruction phase
- `processing`: The processing or practice phase
- `conclusion`: The conclusion phase
- `introduction`: The introduction phase

Each phase has a `content` array that can contain multiple elements. The `processing` phase has an additional `initial_questions` array before its `content` array. These questions usually address practical aspects of the lesson, such as:
- Available resources and materials
- Available space
- Group size

## Element Types

Each element in a phase's content array can be one of the following types:

### Processed Text

```
### Document File

The Document File object is a unique element type specifically designed for use with the Dubbelklik platform. It serves as an answer submission object for uploading files.

```json
{
  "document_file": {
    "uuid": "",
    "#type": "document_file",
    "#title": ""
  }
}
```

This object type should only be used when integration with the Dubbelklik platform's file upload functionality is required. It allows users to submit file-based answers within the lesson structure.

Key points:
- Specific to Dubbelklik platform integration
- Used for file upload answer submissions
- Should not be used for general document references or attachments

### Multiple Choice Question

```
### Open Question

```
## UUID Field

The `"uuid": ""` field should be populated with a unique identifier for each element. This identifier is typically generated by the system and ensures that each element can be uniquely identified within the lesson and across the entire application.

The format of this identifier can vary depending on the system's requirements. It could be a standard UUID, a shorter unique string, or any other format that guarantees uniqueness. For example:

- Standard UUID: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
- Shorter unique string: "a1b2c3d4"
- Custom format: "ELEM_001_XYZ"

The specific format should be consistent within the system and documented separately if it follows a particular pattern or generation method.

## Flexibility

- Each phase's content array can contain any number (including zero) of any type of content element.
- The order and combination of elements within a phase are flexible.
- Not all phases or element types need to be used in every lesson.

## Usage

This structure allows for flexible lesson creation. The system generating or processing this data should ensure that:

1. Each element has appropriate content filled in.
2. The overall structure (lesson_prerequisites, lesson_structure) is completed for each lesson.
3. UUIDs are generated and assigned to each element as needed.

## YAML Conversion

Each object in this JSON structure can be converted to a corresponding YAML format. For detailed information on how each object type is represented in YAML, please refer to the `yaml_element_types_states.yaml` file. This file contains the specific YAML structure for each element type, including:

- Processed Text (in various states: text, large image, text and small image)
- Document File
- Multiple Choice Question (radios)
- Open Question (textarea)

The YAML representation provides an alternative format for the lesson structure, which may be useful for certain integrations or processing tasks.
